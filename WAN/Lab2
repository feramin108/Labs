**Take-Home Exercise: Configure a VPN Tunnel between two Remote Sites**
This exercise simulates configuring a secure connection (VPN tunnel) between two remote office locations. Due to the practicalities of real-world network equipment variations, specific commands will differ. However, this exercise provides a general roadmap you can adapt to most network devices.

Scenario: You are the network administrator for a company with two branch offices, one in Seattle (SEA) and another in Los Angeles (LAX). You need to establish a secure VPN tunnel between them to allow secure communication and data transfer.

Equipment (simulated) GNS3:

Two routers (Router_SEA and Router_LAX) with basic VPN capabilities (IPsec)
Objectives:

Configure IPsec VPN tunnels on both routers.
Establish a secure connection between the two office networks.
Steps:

Gather Information:

IP Addresses: Determine the public IP addresses of both SEA and LAX office internet connections.
Subnets: Identify the private network subnets used at each office location (e.g., SEA: 192.168.1.0/24, LAX: 192.168.2.0/24).
Shared Secret: Choose a strong, pre-shared secret key that will be used for VPN authentication.
Router Configuration:
2.1. Configure Router_SEA:
* Access Router_SEA's configuration interface.
* Enable IPsec VPN.
* Define a VPN transform set specifying encryption and authentication algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA2-512).
* Create a VPN connection (tunnel) with the following details:
* Local IP address: Public IP of SEA office internet connection
* Remote IP address: Public IP of LAX office internet connection
* Pre-shared secret key (same as chosen for LAX router)
* Local subnet: Private network subnet of SEA office (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
* Remote subnet: Private network subnet of LAX office (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24)
2.2. Configure Router_LAX (Repeat steps similar to Router_SEA):
* Configure Router_LAX's VPN settings using the corresponding details:
* Local IP address: Public IP of LAX office internet connection
* Remote IP address: Public IP of SEA office internet connection
* Pre-shared secret key (same as chosen for SEA router)
* Local subnet: Private network subnet of LAX office (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24)
* Remote subnet: Private network subnet of SEA office (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

Verification:

After configuration on both routers, initiate the VPN tunnel from one side (e.g., Router_SEA).
Monitor the router logs on both sides to check for successful tunnel establishment.
Once the tunnel is established, try pinging a device on the remote office network from a device on the local network (e.g., ping 192.168.2.10 from a device in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet).
Important Notes:

This is a simplified exercise. Real-world configurations may involve additional steps like NAT traversal or firewall rule adjustments for VPN traffic.
Consult your specific router's documentation for detailed instructions on configuring IPsec VPN tunnels.
Security is paramount. Choose strong encryption algorithms and pre-shared keys. Consider using more robust authentication methods like certificates instead of pre-shared keys for added security in real-world deployments.
This take-home exercise allows you to explore the basic principles of configuring a VPN tunnel between two networks. Remember to adapt the steps to your specific router model and prioritize security best practices in real-world scenarios.
